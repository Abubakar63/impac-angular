#### Information

- Templates must not use double-quotes for strings. Only html attribute values may be wrapped in double qoutes.
- Templates must be given unique file names.

#### To Do
- By god, do something about the horrible less file.
    - modular / component structure.
- Errors are not giving accurate stack trace lines (something to do with the sourcemaps)
- impacThemingProvier
  - Redesign chartColors to use a different color palette model structure with named colors rather than just an array of hexcodes.
  - Look into how angular material does their theming and build upon impacThemingProvider
