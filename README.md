# impac-angular
---

#### Information

- HTML Templates must not use double-quotes for strings. Only html attribute values may be wrapped in double qoutes.

#### To Do
- By god, do something about the less file.
    - modular / component structure.
- Gulp sourcemap errors are not giving accurate stack trace lines in browser console, have removed for now.
- impacThemingProvier
  - Redesign chartColors to use a different structure with named colors rather than just an array of hexcodes.
  - Look into how angular material does their theming and build upon impacThemingProvider
- fix gulp build watch for better development
- html switches for showing / hiding dashboard features (e.g ability to create dashboard), probably use a provider for this?



TODO: README instructions on required impacLinking provider configurations.
