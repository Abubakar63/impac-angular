# Impac!™ Angular Frontend Library
---
### Description

This project is a User Interface allowing to access the Impac!™ API provided by [Maestrano](http://maestrano.com).

The user is proposed to create dashboards, and to add widgets to these dashboards. A widget displays data calculated by the Impac!™ API, based on the user's company data aggregated by Maestrano Connec!™, while a dashboard is a visual collection of widgets.

### Developers

Impac!™ frontend library can be included in any project based on the Maestrano platform: just fork this repository, have a look at DEVELOPER.md, and start developing your own widgets!

#### Contributing

Any contribution is very welcome and will be considered with great attention by Maestrano's developers team.
